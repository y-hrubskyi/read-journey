# Read Journey App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite + React](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react). To get acquainted and configure additional features [refer to documentation](https://vitejs.dev).

## Overview

Read Journey App is a web application that allows users to register/login to access the system, discover and filter recommended books by title and/or author, and add books to their personal library. Users can add books from the recommended list or manually input their own selections. The platform also offers the ability to filter books based on their reading status (unread, in progress, done, all). Additionally, users can track their reading progress, which is displayed in a journal format, providing detailed statistics on daily reading sessions and overall progress. The project incorporates a responsive design approach to ensure optimal viewing across different devices.
